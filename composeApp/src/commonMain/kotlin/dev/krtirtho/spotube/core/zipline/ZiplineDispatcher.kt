/**
 * Creates a single-threaded coroutine dispatcher suitable for running Zipline/QuickJS.
 *
 * QuickJS's compile() uses deep C-level recursion on the native thread stack.
 * Zipline.create() sets maxStackSize to 6 MiB and expects the calling thread
 * to have at least 8 MiB of stack. On JVM/Android, the default thread stack
 * size is ~1 MiB, which causes native stack overflow when compiling large
 * JS modules like kotlin-stdlib (~491 KB).
 *
 * This expect/actual ensures the backing thread has a sufficiently large stack.
