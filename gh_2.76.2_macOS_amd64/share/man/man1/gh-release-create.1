.SH NAME
gh-release-create - Create a new release


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgh release create [<tag>] [<filename>... | <pattern>...]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a new GitHub Release for a repository.

.PP
A list of asset files may be given to upload to the new release. To define a
display label for an asset, append text starting with \fB#\fR after the file name.

.PP
If a matching git tag does not yet exist, one will automatically get created
from the latest state of the default branch.
Use \fB--target\fR to point to a different branch or commit for the automatic tag creation.
Use \fB--verify-tag\fR to abort the release if the tag doesn't already exist.
To fetch the new tag locally after the release, do \fBgit fetch --tags origin\fR\&.

.PP
To create a release from an annotated git tag, first create one locally with
git, push the tag to GitHub, then run this command.
Use \fB--notes-from-tag\fR to automatically generate the release notes
from the annotated git tag.

.PP
When using automatically generated release notes, a release title will also be automatically
generated unless a title was explicitly passed. Additional release notes can be prepended to
automatically generated notes by using the \fB--notes\fR flag.

.PP
By default, the release is created even if there are no new commits since the last release.
This may result in the same or duplicate release which may not be desirable in some cases.
Use \fB--fail-on-no-commits\fR to fail if no new commits are available. This flag has no
effect if there are no existing releases or this is the very first release.
